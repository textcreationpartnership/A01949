         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the higher he ſat, the lower he looked, the

from life, and the vnfortunate departure
of the Sonne from his Booke; with
dropping eyes diſtilled into teares, and

and woondring at the pithyneſſe of his
ſpeech, which in al his conference neuer
vſed a waſte worde, egged him on to a
farther diſcourſe in this maner.</p>
            <p>I remember <hi>Phialo,</hi> that <hi>Plato</hi> giueth
hartie thanks to Nature, for making him
rather a reaſonable creature, then a brute
beaſt; a man, then a woman; an <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,</hi>
then a <hi>Theban;</hi> and chiefely for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
him life in the time of <hi>Socrates.</hi>
Whoſe example hath humbled me often
before God, with duetiful thankes to his
diuine maieſtie, for faſhioning of me to
his owne likeneſſe, giuing me a mind to
conceiue, and a toung to ſpeake, when he
might haue made me a dumbe beaſt; for
making me rather a man, then a woman
that is, a Lord, then a ſlaue; an <hi>Athenien,</hi>
than a <hi>Theban;</hi> a <hi>Tuſcan,</hi> rather then a

patte of thy ſtudyes to mee, whiche
like a young <hi>Socrates,</hi> applyeſt all thy
knowledge too reforming of manners.
Therefore as thou haſte already begun,
approuing me by ſtrong argumentes, to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:5991:16"/>
be both brainſicke and vnſkilfull in my
proceedings, for dealing ſo roughly with
thee, at ſuch an il time, go forwards, good
<hi>Phialo,</hi> and ſhewe mee aſwell what I
ought to follow, in rebuking my freend,
as thou haſt declared what I ſhall flye,
that through mine owne ignoraunce, I
offend no more. I neuer reſorted to thee
yet ſince our firſt acquaintance, but ere I
departed, I carried ſome leſſons awaye
woorth the noting.</p>
            <p>Not ſo ſir (quoth <hi>Phialo)</hi> It is hard to
draw water in a dry ſoile, or fiſhe out any
ſkil from an emptie pond. <hi>Socrates</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
himſelf to know nothing: &amp; truſt me
I ſe no reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> why <hi>Plato,</hi> which is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

of wiſedome,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Socrates</hi> able to teach nothing becauſe hee knew nothing.</note> ſhoulde reioyce ſo muche to
liue in his time, which was not able too
teach him any more then he knewe. If
he iudge the perſon more luckie then the
man was learned, or thinke it ſufficient
to vertue, to haue beene a ſtudent in thoſe
dayes, he little conſidereth that <hi>Alcibia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>
and <hi>Critias</hi> were both Scholers too
<hi>Socrates,</hi> yet the one a Traytour, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Tyrant. It is not the place wee
are borne in, that maketh vs learned; nor
<pb facs="tcp:5991:17"/>
the name of our mayſter that leades vs
to vertue.</p>
            <p>Thus can I not deuiſe with my ſelf,
<hi>Philotimo,</hi> what it is that ſhould mooue
thee too triumph ſo much in thine owne
conceit, becauſe thou art rather an <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nien,</hi>
then a <hi>Theban;</hi> a <hi>Tuſcan,</hi> then a
<hi>Bargamaske,</hi> as though all were lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,

that dwelt at <hi>Thebes;</hi> or all Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
that are bredde in <hi>Tuſcanie;</hi> or all
Carters, that are borne in <hi>Bargamaske.</hi>
But moſte of all I woonder howe thou
canſt poſſibly ſucke any fruite from my
ſtudies, which are very ſmall, becauſe I
haue loytered; &amp; ſtenderly grounded,
through want of abilitie. Sith thou haſt
likened me to <hi>Socrates,</hi> whoſe <hi>Nihil ſcio</hi>

that wee mighte not ſee: and taught vs
to wander in the darke, giuing no cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite

the <hi>Peripatetikes,</hi> and ſhew thee by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
that I knowe nothing, to driue thee
off from the thinge which thou longeſt
to heare. Which if I ſhould doe, and
dote in thoſe thinges that I dayly ſee, I
am fully perſwaded, when I call for a
Booke, <hi>Philotimo</hi> woulde preſentlye
giue me a Brickbatte, to make me di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
a Stacioners ſhoppe, from a
Stone wall. Therefore acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
my ſelf to be made of a ſoule, and of
a bodie, the one deriued from Heauen,
the fountaine of Knowledge; the other
from Earth, the ſeate of ignoraunce; I
am driuen too confeſſe that I neither
knowe all thinges, which belongeth too
GOD; nor am ignoraunte in all
thinges, which is proper too Beaſtes;
but am perfecte in ſome thinges, vnſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in other, which life is onely peculiar
to man. This doctrine is taught by
<hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> approued by <hi>Foxius,</hi> layde o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
by <hi>Tully,</hi> and ſoundely diſcourſed
by <hi>Lactantius.</hi> Whoſe arguments,
<hi>Philotimo,</hi> I wil not alledge, becauſe I
ſee the ignorant which neuer redde them
will not vnderſtande them; the learned
<pb facs="tcp:5991:18"/>
which knowe them already, will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde
them. And thy ſelfe I perceiue art
more deſirous to heare ſuch thinges, as
are profitable to reforme manners; than
ſuttle, to ſtirre vp diſcention in ſchooles.
The greateſt thing that at this time thou
deſireſt to knowe, is onely this: <hi>Which
way thou mighteſt behaue thy ſelfe to
rebuke thy friende in his fault without
offence.</hi> A buſie prouince no doute for
a ſimple witte, and ſuche a burden as
<hi>Hercules</hi> might refuſe. There are many
good Scholers and grounded Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
in <hi>Sienna,</hi> whoſe ſhoulders would
better become this taſke: yet ſeeing all

therefore haue I choſen ſuch a booke to

only a diſcourſe which liuely diſcribeth

meanes bounty ſtoppes the paſſage of
liberalitie, like the Pellican, which is
ſayd, in ſuccouring her young to wound
herſelfe; and the Adder that giueth life
to her broode, by her owne death. For the
more they let out and diſtribute abrode,
the leſſe they haue in their Coafers at
home. Therefore practizing with <hi>Tullie,</hi>
to giue that continually, which they giue
willingly, they put their handes in their

<hi>Cicero</hi> in the name of <hi>Theophraſtus,</hi>
commendes Hoſpitalitie,<note place="margin">Orat. pro Mar. Marcello.</note> thinking it
very plauſible in great men, to ſet their
doores open to gay gueſtes, to entertaine
forraine Princes very ſumptuouſly, and
reward them richely, by which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
their own ſafetie, increace the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

are they, but ſuch as are able to make vs

the nature of bountie, nor knowes what
belongeth to a benefite. For he is not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall
that giueth to take,<note place="margin">Ariſtotle.</note> becauſe libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
conſiſteth in giuing much, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

like a blind Philoſopher gropes

is the duetie of Princes by good lawes
<pb facs="tcp:5991:53"/>
and ſtatutes to eſtabliſh religion, &amp; force
euery man to liue in order. Where this

teare the crowne from his head, diſherite
his ſonne, and deliuer his kingdome to a
ſtranger. Runne through the ſcriptures,
you ſhall finde them very ſharpely ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
which went about to ſupreſſe Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
<hi>Ieroboam</hi> ſtretcheth out his hand
againſt the Prophet, and it withereth.
<hi>Ahab</hi> robbed God of his honour, empri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned
his meſſengers, and was ſlaine

ſouldiers conſumed with ſier from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen;
<hi>Herod,</hi> forgetting religion and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honouring
God, is eaten with wormes.
I haue often wondered with my ſelfe,
<hi>Philotimo,</hi> knowing Princes to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in their chaire by God, howe they
dare ſuffer any wickednes, in the Court,
which repreſenteth the throne of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
Maieſtie: howe they can poſſibly
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:5991:53"/>
blaſpheme with that tongue which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to honour him, how they preſume
with that ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to murder his ſhepheards,
which they haue receiued to fight for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion?
In that wee haue abundance of
worldly bleſſings, we are earthly; in that
we frame our ſelues to the worſhippe of
God, we are made heauenly. The eies of
brute beaſtes are turned downe to the
earth, to ſeeke nothing but meat for their
bellies: The countenance of man is lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to behold the glorie of God
in his works, which hath made al things
for vs; vs, for him ſelfe, that we might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
his goodnes in the ſame, and
honour him for it all the daies of our life.
If we do not this, wee ſpend our time in
beholding the earth, wee ſeeke nothing
els but to garniſh our bodies, or pamper
our fleſh, which maketh vs like vnto ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage
beaſtes. Then what is the glory of
a Courtier without religion? What is
his gouernement without godlines?</p>
            <p>If thou wilt prooue a good Courtier,
<hi>Philotimo,</hi> depart from <hi>Ferara,</hi> the pit
of Ignorance: the ſtorehouſe of greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes;
the palace of Flatterers; the ſlewes
<pb facs="tcp:5991:54"/>
of Idolatrie, and trauell to Englande,
where thou ſhalt finde a countrie, ſo go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned
with good lawes; a people, ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
in the feare of God; a church, ſo
reformed in religion; a Court, ſo learned,
ſo liberall, ſo vertuous, ſo godlie, a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bora,</hi>

for ſo good a prince. By this little ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe
of a courtier, which, as time will

workemen may gather the breadth of his

Ieraldi</hi> perceiuing the gentleman come

that if they iudged him to bee rebuked

as well as I can.</p>
            <p>The ſkilfull that beholde the Image
of <hi>Minerua,</hi> commende not the picture

Thus when I do gaze on a comely body,

to turne your rippetes, to chaunge your

haue they not ſo tyed our life to their

of this little worlde, which is in our

cry out againſt them, &amp; the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
of nature proclame them traitours,
how can I but ſeek my wonted delights,
or gape after pleaſure, the foode of this
life. Nature hath taught vs, in plentiful
orchardes, to taſte euery tree, and choſe
the beſt: in pleaſant fields to ſlip, off the
fayreſt of euery ſtalke: and are not wee
think you, placed in this world to try eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
gallant, &amp; take what we like. This is
the race we ought to runne, this is the
mark we ought to ſhoot at, this is the end
which Nature ſendeth vs out too ſeeke.
Little children are no ſooner borne, but
they ſprawle to this, crowing pertely
when they obtaine it, crying &amp; bellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
when they finde the contrary. In ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

<pb facs="tcp:5991:66"/>
Doth not any man thinke you rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to treade the ſmoth ground, than the
rugged ſtones; to ſaile in a calme, then in
a ſtorme; to liue in quietnes then in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?
and what is this to be counted but
pleaſure? you wil ſay peraduenture that it
is ſo, but the happines that we are bound
to ſeeke, muſt be won by vertue, &amp; deſired
for it ſelf. What if I ſhew you that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
is ſuch? All that we doe, all that we
go about in this life, is to purchaſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
which I thinke ſomtime to be felte
in torment: as <hi>Caius Marius,</hi> that ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

for eaſe to come. Thus the paine that we
ſuffer to ſhun a worſe griefe, is very high
pleaſure. Let vs ſuppoſe ſome one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be greeuouſly oppreſſed with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh

any pleaſure paſt, nor hoping for
any to come heereafter, can there be any
greater miſerie? Contrary, to him in
whom all pleaſures of body and minde
abound, which delighteth in that he hath
taſted already, reioyceth in that which is
before him, &amp; hopes for the like or grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:5991:66"/>
to come, can there be any thing more
to be wiſhed? can there bee any ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
felicitie? Louers diſdayned and daſht
out of countenaunce, when they neither
taſte of releefe, nor ſee any hope of grace
at all, ſay that they feele in them ſelues a
hel, but he that obtayneth the ioyes he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired,
affirmeth himſelf to ſwim in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen:
whereby I gather, that hell is a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe,
ſorowe miſery, heauen a pleaſure,
and pleaſure happines. Vices are to bee
fled becauſe of torment; &amp; is not vertue to
be ſought for pleaſures ſake? we like of
Phiſicke, not for the art, but for the ende;
the end is health, which eaſeth our paine
and bringeth pleaſure: we delight in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faring,
not for the cunning of guiding
ſhippes, but for the commoditie which
it breeds: and commoditie is handmaide
to lady Pleaſure. What thinke you of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
vertue in general? is not wiſedom a
knowledge of things to be folowed, when
they are good; to be eſchewed, when they
are naught? If they bee good, they are

And though hee ſpoke his pleaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſte

It is a harde matter too make an olde

it correcteth vnthriſty Schollers;
<hi>Demoſthenes</hi> orations ſmelt of ſampe

Therefore let me holde the ſame propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition

drewe out of <hi>Tully,</hi> that ancient Poetes

for gaine, and that made her ſelf as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
as a Barbars chayre by Poets is
placed for a goddeſſe in heauen. Al theſe
whome the Poetes haue called gods and
goddeſſes, for the moſt part, were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtardes
begotten in adulterie, or very
lewde liuers, which had no ſoner defiled
their beddes, but they were ſnatchte vp

what ſtuffe is this? wantons in heauen? &amp;
a double diuinitie of he gods, &amp; ſhe gods?
If it be ſo, I hope they will graunt me,
that in that place nothing ought to bee
vayne; if nothing be vaine, they muſt liue
together by couples like man and wife,
or holde the publique weale of <hi>Plato,</hi> and
make euery thing common. If they liue
together in lawfull marriage, giue them
houſes to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues for lawfull encreaſe,
that all which they do be not ſeene in the

God is perfect and almighty. Being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,

he ſaluted the one by the others name:
And becauſe his maſhippe would ſeeme

and nine Fidlers heads to make him an

that he ſtuck faſt continually in the midſt
